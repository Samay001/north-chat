# North Chat

Currently a Work In Progress, North Chat is a chat application that allows users to create chat rooms and communicate with other users in real time. The application is built using Django and Django Channels with a React frontend.

## Django
Go to the `backend` directory to check the Django task

## Frontend
Go to the `frontend` directory to check the Frontend task. I used React with shadcn for a better design.

## AWS
Go to the `aws` directory to check the AWS task.
